## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Mediqom implements multiple layers of security and privacy protection:

### Privacy-First Architecture
- **Client-side Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted before leaving the client
- **Zero-Knowledge Design**: Server cannot access unencrypted medical data
- **User-Controlled Keys**: Users maintain control of their encryption keys

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with authentication requirements
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trails for all medical data access
- **Data Minimization**: Only relevant data accessed and logged
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time security validation and monitoring

### Technical Security
- **End-to-End Encryption**: AES-GCM encryption for data at rest
- **Secure Communication**: TLS encryption for data in transit
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and ensures system stability
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers

1. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Review Core Systems**
   - Start with [Context Management System](./CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.md) for AI features
   - Review [Clinical Data Platform](./CLINICAL_DATA_PLATFORM.md) for data architecture
   - Check [Beta Access System](./BETA_ACCESS_SYSTEM.md) for user management

3. **Key Development Concepts**
   - **MCP Tools**: Use `secureMcpTools` for medical data access
   - **Context Assembly**: Leverage context system for AI interactions
   - **Security First**: Always use security validation and audit logging
   - **Privacy Preservation**: Keep sensitive data client-side encrypted

### For System Administrators
