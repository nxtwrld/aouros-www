**Migration Requirements:**
- No schema changes required for core compatibility
- Enhanced features can be added as optional fields
- Existing data remains fully functional

## Breaking Changes Assessment

### None Required for Core Functionality

The analysis reveals **no breaking changes** are required for core system functionality. All enhancements can be implemented as additive features.

### Optional Breaking Changes for Enhanced Features

1. **Enhanced Signal Processing** (Optional)
   - New validation pipeline requires external MCP integration
   - Enhanced urgency calculation may change scoring methodology

- ✅ **Extends Interface**: `EnhancedSignal` extends existing `Signal`
- ✅ **Preserves Data**: All existing signal data remains valid through automatic migration
- ✅ **Lazy Migration**: Signals migrate automatically when documents are accessed
- ✅ **Zero Data Loss**: Migration strategy ensures 100% data preservation
- ✅ **Gradual Rollout**: New features activate per document type

### Phase 4: UI Modernization (Weeks 11-14)
**Objective**: Implement specialized document components
- ⚠️ **UI Changes**: New components for enhanced document types
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to existing components

4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced observability for new components
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for compatibility scenarios

## Recommendations

### 1. Implement as Extensions, Not Replacements
- Build new AI strategies as additional analysis types
- Preserve existing schemas and processing logic
- Add enhanced features as optional capabilities

### 2. Maintain API Compatibility
