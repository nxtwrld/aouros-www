## Current Priorities

### **Phase 1: UI Component Completion** (Weeks 1-2)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Focus**: Implement missing specialized medical section components
- **Components Needed**: SectionSpecimens, SectionMicroscopic, SectionAnesthesia, SectionECG, SectionEcho, SectionTreatments, SectionAssessment, SectionTumorCharacteristics, SectionTreatmentPlan, SectionAllergies, SectionSocialHistory

### **Phase 2: MCP External Validation** (Weeks 3-4)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Focus**: Implement external medical database validation
- **Components**: Remove hardcoded skip logic, add medical database lookups, implement FHIR validation

### **Phase 3: Production Monitoring** (Weeks 5-6)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Focus**: Enhanced monitoring and analytics
- **Components**: LangSmith integration, performance metrics, cost tracking

## Next Actions

1. **Update remaining outdated documents** (AI_IMPORT_02, AI_IMPORT_03, AI_IMPORT_07, AI_IMPORT_10)
2. **Implement missing UI components** for specialized medical sections
3. **Complete MCP integration** for external validation
