# AI Import Modernization - TODO List

> **Current Status**: 90-95% Complete | **Architecture**: âœ… Fully Implemented | **Performance**: âœ… Mostly Complete | **UX**: âœ… SSE Implemented

Based on comparison with `AI_IMPORT_02_MODERNIZATION_STRATEGY.md`, this document outlines the remaining tasks to complete our LangGraph-based modernization.

**Architecture Decision**: Maintaining two-endpoint approach for optimal performance:

- `/v1/import/extract` (+ `/stream`) - Fast OCR/text extraction with cheaper models
- `/v1/import/report` (+ `/stream`) - Deep medical analysis with LangGraph workflow

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 1: Performance & User Experience (Weeks 1-2)**

### **1.1 SSE Integration for Real-time Progress** âœ… COMPLETED

_Priority: HIGH | Impact: User Experience_

- [x] **Implement SSE endpoints** for both extraction and analysis
  - âœ… Create `/src/routes/v1/import/extract/stream/+server.ts` for real-time OCR/extraction progress
  - âœ… Create `/src/routes/v1/import/report/stream/+server.ts` for real-time analysis progress
  - âœ… Keep existing endpoints for backwards compatibility
  - âœ… Add SSE response headers and streaming capabilities to both
- [x] **Connect LangGraph workflow to import process**
  - âœ… Connect LangGraph to `/v1/import/report/stream` for medical analysis
  - âœ… Keep existing `assess()` in `/v1/import/extract` for OCR/pre-assessment
  - âœ… Modify `document-processing.ts` to emit progress after each node
  - âœ… Add progress tracking to `DocumentProcessingState`
- [x] **Add progress events** to all workflow nodes:

  - âœ… `input-validation.ts` - Document received and validated
  - âœ… `document-type-router.ts` - Document type detected
  - âœ… `feature-detection.ts` - Features analyzed
  - âœ… `medical-analysis.ts` - Medical content extracted
  - âœ… `signal-processing.ts` - Signals processed and enhanced
  - âœ… `quality-gate.ts` - Final validation complete

- [ ] **Frontend SSE integration** in document upload components
  - Update upload UI to show real-time progress for both extraction and analysis
  - Add two-stage progress indicators:
    - Stage 1: OCR/Extraction progress from `/extract/stream`
    - Stage 2: Medical analysis progress from `/report/stream`
  - Maintain backwards compatibility with existing endpoints

### **1.2 Multi-Image Processing Architecture (Pre-LangGraph)** âœ… MOSTLY COMPLETED

_Priority: HIGH | Impact: Data Completeness_

> **Key Insight**: Decision logic should happen in `assess()` function in `assessInputs.ts`, not at API level
> **Flow**: `/v1/import/extract` â†’ `assess()` â†’ image type detection â†’ route to appropriate processing
> **CRITICAL**: Must preserve document splitting functionality - multi-page documents split into individual documents
> **STATUS**: Document splitting and multi-image processing are preserved in extract/stream endpoint

- [x] **Implement image type detection and routing in `assess()` function**
  - âœ… Extract stream endpoint processes multiple images via `assess()` function
  - âœ… Document splitting logic preserved and working
  - [ ] Add enhanced `analyzeImageTypes()` function in `assessInputs.ts` for specialized routing
- [x] **Phase 1: Enhanced Multi-Image Text Processing**
  - âœ… **Trigger**: Documents with text content (lab reports, clinical notes, prescriptions)
  - âœ… **Implementation**: Extract stream processes multiple images with document splitting
  - âœ… Process multiple images with page-by-page analysis via existing `assess()` function
  - âœ… Preserve existing GPT-4o/Gemini vision approach
  - âœ… **PRESERVE**: Document splitting logic - identify multiple documents within pages
  - âœ… **PRESERVE**: `Assessment` interface with `pages[]` and `documents[]` arrays
  - âœ… Maintain existing `Assessment` interface for backward compatibility
- [ ] **Phase 2: Direct Medical Image Analysis Pathway**

  - **Trigger**: Images identified as medical imagery (DICOM, X-rays, pathology)
  - **Implementation**: Create `handleDirectMedicalImageAnalysis()` function
  - Bypass text extraction, route directly to specialized medical image analysis
  - **PRESERVE**: Document splitting for medical images (e.g., multiple DICOM series)
  - Return results in same `Assessment` format to maintain API contract

- [x] **Document Splitting Feature Preservation** âœ… COMPLETED

  - âœ… **Critical Feature**: Current `assess()` function intelligently splits multi-page uploads into separate documents
  - âœ… **Current Logic**: Uses AI to determine if pages belong to same document or multiple documents
  - âœ… **Schema**: `documents[]` array maps document titles to their constituent `pages[]`
  - âœ… **Examples**:
    - Multi-page lab report â†’ Single document with pages [1,2]
    - Mixed upload (prescription + lab report) â†’ Two documents with pages [1] and [2]
  - âœ… **Requirement**: Document splitting preserved in extract/stream endpoint

- [x] **Multi-Language Support Preservation** âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… **Critical Feature**: System supports documents in multiple languages with user-selected normalization
  - âœ… **Current Capabilities**:
    - âœ… **Language Detection**: AI-based detection with fallback to English
    - âœ… **Schema Localization**: All medical schemas support `[LANGUAGE]` placeholders
    - âœ… **Dual Content Storage**: Original content + localized content preservation
    - âœ… **User Language Selection**: EN/CS/DE support with URL routing
  - âœ… **Examples**:
    - German lab report â†’ German original + English normalized version
    - Czech prescription â†’ Czech original + User's selected language
  - âœ… **Requirement**: Both processing phases preserve original content AND provide normalized versions
