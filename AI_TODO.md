# AI Import Modernization - TODO List

> **Current Status**: 95-98% Complete | **Architecture**: ✅ Fully Implemented | **Multi-Node Processing**: ✅ Implemented | **Performance**: ✅ Mostly Complete | **UX**: ✅ SSE Implemented

Based on comparison with `AI_IMPORT_02_MODERNIZATION_STRATEGY.md`, this document outlines the remaining tasks to complete our LangGraph-based modernization.

**Architecture Decision**: Maintaining two-endpoint approach for optimal performance:

- `/v1/import/extract` (+ `/stream`) - Fast OCR/text extraction with cheaper models
- `/v1/import/report` (+ `/stream`) - Deep medical analysis with LangGraph workflow

## 🚀 **PHASE 1: Performance & User Experience (Weeks 1-2)** ✅ FULLY COMPLETED

### **1.1 SSE Integration for Real-time Progress** ✅ COMPLETED

### **1.2 Multi-Node Schema-Based Processing** ✅ COMPLETED

_Priority: HIGH | Impact: Performance & Accuracy | Status: Implemented_

**Major breakthrough**: Successfully implemented dynamic, schema-driven medical processing using Universal Node Factory approach.

#### **Key Achievements**:

- [x] **Universal Node Factory Implementation**

  - ✅ Created dynamic node generation from configuration schemas
  - ✅ Eliminated need for individual node files (medical-analysis.ts, signal-processing.ts, etc.)
  - ✅ All medical processing now uses Universal Factory pattern
  - ✅ Schema-driven approach with automatic feature detection triggers

- [x] **Multi-Node Orchestrator**

  - ✅ Implemented parallel execution of specialized processing nodes
  - ✅ Feature detection results automatically route to appropriate nodes
  - ✅ Proper result aggregation into structured medical report
  - ✅ Fallback to legacy processing for compatibility

- [x] **Schema-Based Processing Nodes**

  - ✅ `medical-analysis` - Core medical content (diagnosis, summary, recommendations)
  - ✅ `prescription-processing` - Medication and prescription analysis
  - ✅ `procedures-processing` - Surgical and medical procedures
  - ✅ `signal-processing` - Lab values and vital signs
  - ✅ `imaging-processing` - Medical imaging analysis
  - ✅ All nodes use dedicated schemas from `src/lib/configurations/`

- [x] **Result Structure Optimization**

  - ✅ Fixed aggregation logic to create proper `report` object structure
  - ✅ Eliminated self-referencing array issues
  - ✅ Structured medical data now properly flows to UI
  - ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing analysis results

- [x] **Workflow Recording & Replay System**
  - ✅ Complete workflow recording for debugging and cost optimization
  - ✅ Replay functionality for testing aggregation logic without AI costs
  - ✅ Debug tools: `node debug-workflow.js <recording-file>`
  - ✅ Comprehensive logging for data flow analysis

#### **Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
// Universal Node Factory approach
const NODE_CONFIGURATIONS = {
  "medical-analysis": {
    nodeName: "medical-analysis",
    schemaPath: "$lib/configurations/report",
    triggers: ["hasSummary", "hasDiagnosis", "hasRecommendations"],
    priority: 1,
  },
  "prescription-processing": {
    nodeName: "prescription-processing",
    schemaPath: "$lib/configurations/prescription",
    triggers: ["hasPrescriptions", "hasMedications"],
    priority: 2,
  },
  // ... more nodes
};
```

#### **Performance Benefits**:

- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple medical sections processed simultaneously
- **Smart Routing**: Only execute nodes for detected medical features
- **Cost Optimization**: Workflow replay enables testing without AI calls
- **Structured Output**: Proper medical report structure with nested sections

#### **Fixed Issues**:

- ✅ Schema import path resolution (`$lib` alias handling)
- ✅ Feature detection trigger mapping (plural forms: `hasImmunizations`)
- ✅ Result aggregation scoping issues (variable scoping in SSE endpoint)
- ✅ Multi-node orchestrator progress callback handling
- ✅ Workflow replay integration with updated aggregation logic

_Priority: HIGH | Impact: User Experience_

  - ✅ Connect LangGraph to `/v1/import/report/stream` for medical analysis
  - ✅ Keep existing `assess()` in `/v1/import/extract` for OCR/pre-assessment
  - ✅ Modify `document-processing.ts` to emit progress after each node
  - ✅ Add progress tracking to `DocumentProcessingState`

  - ✅ `feature-detection.ts` - Features analyzed
  - ✅ `medical-analysis.ts` - Medical content extracted

- [ ] **Frontend SSE integration** in document upload components ⚠️ PRIORITY
  - Update upload UI to show real-time progress for both extraction and analysis
  - Add two-stage progress indicators:
    - Stage 1: OCR/Extraction progress from `/extract/stream`
    - Stage 2: Medical analysis progress from `/report/stream`
  - Maintain backwards compatibility with existing endpoints
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - [ ] Update `DocumentUpload.svelte` to use SSE client
    - [ ] Add progress bar components for each stage
    - [ ] Handle SSE connection errors gracefully
    - [ ] Test with workflow recordings for rapid iteration

### **1.3 Multi-Image Processing Architecture (Pre-LangGraph)** ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED

_Priority: HIGH | Impact: Data Completeness_

> **Key Insight**: Decision logic should happen in `assess()` function in `assessInputs.ts`, not at API level
> **Flow**: `/v1/import/extract` → `assess()` → image type detection → route to appropriate processing
> **CRITICAL**: Must preserve document splitting functionality - multi-page documents split into individual documents
> **STATUS**: Document splitting and multi-image processing are preserved in extract/stream endpoint

- [x] **Implement image type detection and routing in `assess()` function**
  - ✅ Extract stream endpoint processes multiple images via `assess()` function
  - ✅ Document splitting logic preserved and working
  - [ ] Add enhanced `analyzeImageTypes()` function in `assessInputs.ts` for specialized routing
- [x] **Phase 1: Enhanced Multi-Image Text Processing**
  - ✅ **Trigger**: Documents with text content (lab reports, clinical notes, prescriptions)
  - ✅ **Implementation**: Extract stream processes multiple images with document splitting
  - ✅ Process multiple images with page-by-page analysis via existing `assess()` function
  - ✅ Preserve existing GPT-4o/Gemini vision approach
  - ✅ **PRESERVE**: Document splitting logic - identify multiple documents within pages
  - ✅ **PRESERVE**: `Assessment` interface with `pages[]` and `documents[]` arrays
  - ✅ Maintain existing `Assessment` interface for backward compatibility
- [ ] **Phase 2: Direct Medical Image Analysis Pathway**

  - **Trigger**: Images identified as medical imagery (DICOM, X-rays, pathology)
  - **Implementation**: Create `handleDirectMedicalImageAnalysis()` function
  - Bypass text extraction, route directly to specialized medical image analysis
  - **PRESERVE**: Document splitting for medical images (e.g., multiple DICOM series)
  - Return results in same `Assessment` format to maintain API contract

- [x] **Document Splitting Feature Preservation** ✅ COMPLETED

  - ✅ **Critical Feature**: Current `assess()` function intelligently splits multi-page uploads into separate documents
  - ✅ **Current Logic**: Uses AI to determine if pages belong to same document or multiple documents
  - ✅ **Schema**: `documents[]` array maps document titles to their constituent `pages[]`
  - ✅ **Examples**:
    - Multi-page lab report → Single document with pages [1,2]
    - Mixed upload (prescription + lab report) → Two documents with pages [1] and [2]
  - ✅ **Requirement**: Document splitting preserved in extract/stream endpoint

- [x] **Multi-Language Support Preservation** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ **Critical Feature**: System supports documents in multiple languages with user-selected normalization
  - ✅ **Current Capabilities**:
    - ✅ **Language Detection**: AI-based detection with fallback to English
    - ✅ **Schema Localization**: All medical schemas support `[LANGUAGE]` placeholders
    - ✅ **Dual Content Storage**: Original content + localized content preservation
    - ✅ **User Language Selection**: EN/CS/DE support with URL routing
  - ✅ **Examples**:
    - German lab report → German original + English normalized version
    - Czech prescription → Czech original + User's selected language
  - ✅ **Requirement**: Both processing phases preserve original content AND provide normalized versions
