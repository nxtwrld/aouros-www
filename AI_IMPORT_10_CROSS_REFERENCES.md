## Key Integration Areas

### 1. **Signal Processing Integration**

**Document Import Integration:**
- Document import workflows extract signals during Step 8 (Signals Normalization)
- Enhanced signal discovery and validation through LangGraph workflows
- Real-time signal validation using external medical databases

**Cross-References:**
- [AI_IMPORT_01_CURRENT_ANALYSIS.md](./AI_IMPORT_01_CURRENT_ANALYSIS.md) - Step 8: Signals Normalization
- [AI_SIGNALS_IMPORT.md](./AI_SIGNALS_IMPORT.md) - Enhanced signal processing architecture
- [AI_IMPORT_06_EXTERNAL_TOOLS.md](./AI_IMPORT_06_EXTERNAL_TOOLS.md) - MCP integration for signal validation

### 2. **Document Type Signal Support**

**Enhanced Signal Extraction:**
- Laboratory documents: Advanced lab result parsing with reference ranges
- Dental documents: Tooth-specific signal extraction (teeth 1-32)
- Imaging documents: DICOM metadata and measurement extraction
- Prescription documents: Medication dosage and frequency signals

**Implementation:**
- Shared signal schemas across document types
- Unified signal normalization pipeline
- Cross-document signal correlation

### 3. **LangGraph Workflow Coordination**

**Shared Workflow Patterns:**
- Common provider abstraction layer across all AI operations
- Unified state management patterns for complex workflows
- Shared monitoring and evaluation infrastructure

**Integration Points:**
- Document import workflows can trigger session analysis workflows
- Session analysis can reference imported document data
- Shared caching and optimization strategies

### 4. **External Validation Alignment**

**Medical Database Integration:**
- Medication validation (Medi-Span, SUKL, DrugBank)
- Diagnosis code validation (ICD-10, SNOMED CT)
- Lab reference range validation
- Drug interaction checking

**Consistency:**
- Same MCP servers used across document import and session analysis
- Unified validation criteria and confidence scoring
- Shared error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Implementation Coordination

### Phase Alignment
Both document import and session analysis modernization follow aligned phases:

1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-3)**: Shared provider abstraction and basic LangGraph structure
2. **Core Infrastructure (Weeks 4-6)**: Parallel workflow implementation and provider selection
3. **Enhancement (Weeks 7-9)**: SSE integration and external validation
4. **Production (Weeks 10-12)**: Monitoring, quality assurance, and deployment

### Shared Components

**Provider Registry:**
- Location: `src/lib/workflows/providers/registry.ts`
- Supports: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq
- Features: Intelligent selection, fallback chains, cost optimization

**Monitoring Infrastructure:**
- Location: `src/lib/workflows/monitoring/`
- Tools: LangSmith integration, metrics collection, evaluation framework
- Shared across all AI workflows

**Schema Management:**
- Location: `src/lib/workflows/schemas/`
- Features: Enhanced schema system with localization and validation
- Reused across document types and analysis types

### Development Coordination

**Team Responsibilities:**
- Core workflow team: Provider abstraction and LangGraph infrastructure
- Document team: Document-specific nodes and schemas
- Session team: Session-specific nodes and real-time features
- Integration team: Cross-workflow coordination and shared components

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for individual nodes and providers
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- End-to-end tests for cross-feature scenarios
- Performance tests for concurrent operations

### Migration Strategy

**Parallel Development:**
- Document import and session analysis can be developed simultaneously
- Shared components developed first to enable parallel work
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition
- Gradual migration with rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring during deployment
