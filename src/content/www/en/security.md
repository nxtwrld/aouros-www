# Your Data Stays Yours

## Zero-Knowledge Security That Actually Works

**The Promise**: Even we can't see your private medical data.  
**The Reality**: It's mathematically impossible for us to access your information.

This isn't just marketing - it's how we built our entire platform.

## How Zero-Knowledge Encryption Works

### Traditional Cloud Storage (Vulnerable)

    A[Your Data] --> B[Encrypted with Service Key]
    B --> C[Stored in Cloud]
    C --> D[Service Can Decrypt Anytime]

```

### Mediqom's Zero-Knowledge Architecture

## Your Encryption Key, Your Control

### How We Generate Your Keys

1. **Client-Side Generation**: Your encryption keys are created on your device
2. **Never Transmitted**: Your private key never leaves your control
3. **Password-Protected**: Additional encryption with your chosen passphrase
4. **Mathematically Secure**: RSA-4096 and AES-256 encryption standards

### What This Means for You

- ✅ **Complete Privacy**: We literally cannot read your medical records
- ✅ **Zero Data Breaches**: Even if our servers are compromised, your data is useless
- ✅ **Your Control**: Share exactly what you want, with whom you want
- ✅ **International Safe**: Your data sovereignty respected everywhere

## Compliance by Design

## Transparency Reports

### Security Metrics (Updated Monthly)

- **Uptime**: 99.97% availability
- **Incident Response**: Average 15 minutes
- **Vulnerability Patching**: Within 24 hours
- **Third-Party Audits**: Quarterly penetration testing

### What We Can See vs. What We Can't

#### We CAN See:

- Account creation timestamps
- Number of files uploaded (not content)
- API usage patterns
- System performance metrics

#### We CANNOT See:

- Your medical records content
- Your personal information
- Your uploaded documents
- Your session conversations
- Your AI analysis results

## Sharing Without Compromising

### Granular Control

Choose exactly what to share:

- **Specific Documents**: Share only relevant records
- **Time-Limited Access**: Set expiration dates
- **Read-Only Sharing**: Prevent data modification
- **Audit Trail**: See who accessed what and when

### Healthcare Provider Access

```mermaid

    participant Patient
    participant Mediqom
    participant Doctor

    Patient->>Mediqom: Generate secure sharing link
    Mediqom->>Patient: Encrypted link with access controls
    Patient->>Doctor: Share link via secure channel
    Doctor->>Mediqom: Access with time-limited token
    Mediqom->>Doctor: Decrypt only shared data
    Doctor->>Patient: Provide medical consultation
```

## Emergency Access

### Family Emergency Protocols

- **Trusted Contacts**: Designate emergency access persons
- **Emergency Cards**: Physical access codes for EMTs
- **Medical Alerts**: Critical information always accessible
- **Recovery Procedures**: Family can access data if needed

### Healthcare Emergency Access

- **No Delays**: Instant access to life-saving information

## Comparing Security Approaches

| Security Model        | Data Breach Risk              | Access Control          | Compliance         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Traditional Cloud** | High - Your data exposed      | Service controls access | Basic compliance   |
| **Encrypted Cloud**   | Medium - Service has keys     | Service controls access | Better compliance  |
| **Zero-Knowledge**    | None - Encrypted data useless | You control access      | Maximum compliance |

## International Data Sovereignty

## Questions About Security?

### Common Concerns

**Q: What if I forget my passphrase?**  
A: Your data becomes unrecoverable. This is by design for maximum security.

**Q: Can governments force you to decrypt my data?**  
A: Impossible. We don't have your encryption keys.

**Q: How do I know you're not lying about zero-knowledge?**  
A: Our code is auditable, and third-party security firms verify our claims.

**Q: Is this really as secure as you claim?**  
A: More secure. Even we can't access your data if we wanted to.
