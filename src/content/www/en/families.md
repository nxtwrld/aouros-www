# Keep Your Family's Health Story Together

## The Problem Every Family Faces

Where are your important medical records right now?

- Your child's vaccination history? *Somewhere in that drawer...*
- Your spouse's allergy list? *Was it in an email?*
- Your parent's medications? *Which doctor had that list?*
- Last year's lab results? *No idea where those went...*
